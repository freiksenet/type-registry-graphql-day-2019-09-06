# What is "programmatic"?

</Invert>

---

## Programmatic `<>` Declarative

---

## SDL is programmatic

---

```graphql
type Foo {
  id: ID!
}
```

---

## GraphQL Frameworks are declarative

#### Prisma

#### AWS AppSync

#### GraphCMS

---

## graphql-js declarative too

Oh the irony

---

```js
const Foo = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Foo',
  fields: {
    id: {
      type: GraphQLID,
    },
  },
})
```

---

# Programmatic is
## using functions to create new types

---

```js
function renameObjectType(type, newName) {
  const config = type.toConfig()
  return new GraphQLObjectType({
    ...config,
    name: newName,
  })
}
```

---

```js
function createEdgeType(type) {
  // ...
}

function createConnectionType(type) {
  // ...
}
```

---

# POV is important

<Appear>

## User vs Library author

</Appear>

---

<Invert>

# Why and why not?

</Invert>

---

## NB: You might not need it

---

# Use case

## Different source of truth

---

# Examples

<Appear>

## AppSync - user config

## PostGraphile - DB

## Gatsby - nodes

## SDL - SDL text

</Appear>

---

# Use case

## Multiple sources of truth

---

# Examples

<Appear>

## Gatsby

## Schema Stitching

</Appear>

---

# Use case

## Repetitive/generic types

---

# Examples

<Appear>

## Relay Connections

## Input objects

</Appear>

---

# Use case

## Creating types partially

---

# Examples

<Appear>

## Back-references

## Gatsby

</Appear>

---


<Invert>

# How?

</Invert>

---

# graphql-js

## has some issues

---

## Types must be defined

```js
const Foo = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Foo',
  fields: {
    bar: {
      type: Bar
    }
  }
})
```

---

## Workaround - Thunks


```js
  // ---
  fields: () => ({
    bar: {
      type: Bar
    }
  })
```

---

## Circular modules

---

## Workaround - Thunks 2

```js
  // ---
  fields: () => {
    const { Bar } = require('./Bar')
    return {
      bar: {
        type: Bar
      }
    }
  }
```

---

# Inspecting fields

```js
foo.getFields()
```

---

## Types need to be *complete*

---

## Unknown type names

```graphql
type Foo {
  bar: Bar
}
```

---

## Workaround - ???

---

## Enter Type Registry

```js
export typeRegistry = {}
```

---

# WUT?

```js
import typeRegistry from './typeRegistry'
  // ---
  fields: () => ({
    bar: {
      type: typeRegistry['Bar']
    })
  }
  // ---
typeRegistry['Foo'] = Foo
```

---

# Type registry

<Appear>

## State of schema creation

## Naively just holds types by name

## Could be much more

</Appear>

---

## Better TR - autoadd types

```
typeRegistry.createObjectType({
  name: "Foo",
  fields: () => ({
    bar: {
      type: typeRegistry.getType('Bar')
    }
  }),
})
```

---

## Better  TR - resolve string types

```
typeRegistry.createObjectType({
  name: "Foo",
  fields: {
    bar: {
      type: 'Bar'
    }
  },
})
```

---

## Better TR - extend types

```js
typeRegistry.getType('Bar').extendFields({
  bars: {
    type: 'Foo'
  },
})
```

---

## Better TR - getOrCreate

```
typeRegistry.getOrCreateObjectType('Foo', () => {
  // config if doesn't exist
})
```

---

## Better TR -  Build types to a schema

```js
typeRegistry.buildSchema()
```

---

## Better TR - Creating derived types

```js
typeRegistry.getType('Bar').toInputObjectType()
```

---

## Better Type Registry

<Appear>

### Holds all types

### Concise programmatic syntax

### Type modification after creation

### Helpes to create types

</Appear>

---

# Should I create my own?

<Appear>

## Maybe not!

## graphql-compose

</Appear>

---

# graphql-compose

<Appear>

## Library implementing type registry

## Has all the features I describe above and more

## Used extensively at Gatsby

</Appear>

---

<Invert>

# Usage at Gatsby?

</Invert>

---

# Gatsby GraphQL is special

<Appear>

## Multiple sources of truth

## Partially inferred though data

## Query roots are similar for all types

</Appear>

---

# Inferrence

---

# Defined types

---

# Schema control through extensions

---

# Declarative, composable resolvers

---

# Generated query roots

---

<Invert>

# Takeaways

</Invert>

---

# Takeaway 1

## You might not need it

---

# Takeaway 2

## Use if non-graphql source of truth


---

# Takeaway 3

## Use to simplify repeated types

---

# Takeaway 4

## Type Registry is a key pattern

---

# Takeaway 5

## Use graphql-compose ;)

---

# Thank you (also use Gatsby)
